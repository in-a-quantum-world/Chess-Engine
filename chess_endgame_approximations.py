In the endgame:[49]

R = B (unpaired) + 2P, and R > N + 2P (slightly); but if a rook is added on both sides, the situation favours the minor piece side
2N are only trivially better than R + P in the endgame (slightly worse if there are no other pieces), but adding a rook on both sides gives the knights a big advantage
2B ≈ R + 2P; adding a rook on both sides makes the bishops superior
R + 2B + P ≈ 2R + N
In the threshold case (queen versus other pieces):[49]

Q ≥ 2R with all minor pieces still on the board, but Q + P = 2R with none of them (because the queen derives more advantage from cooperating with minor pieces than the rooks do)
Q > R + N (or unpaired B) + P, even if another pair of rooks is added
Q + minor ≈ R + 2B + P (slightly favouring the rook side)
3 minors > Q, especially if the minors include the bishop pair. The difference is about a pawn if rooks are still on the board (because in this case they help the minors more than the queen); with all rooks still on the board, 2B + N > Q + P (slightly).
In the middlegame case:[49]

B > N (slightly)
N = 4P
The exchange is worth:
just under 2 pawns if it is unpaired R vs N, but less if the rook is paired, and a bit less still if the minor piece is an unpaired bishop
one pawn if it is paired R vs paired B
2B + P = R + N with extra rooks on the board
2N > R + 2P, especially with an extra pair of rooks
2B = R + 3P with extra rooks on the board

FOR THE EVALUATION
encourage the pair of bishops to be used
avoid exchanging one minor piece for 3 pawns
